  Commit Guru can analyze your repository and let you know how risky your team's changes have been over time. We provide a
  metric-by-metric breakdown for each commit you or your contributors make. Your repositories get pulled to our server allowing
  us to run various alogrithms over each change to build a model for your repository. With the model we can predict if a
  change is likely to introduce a bug.
